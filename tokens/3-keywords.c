case: Used in switch statements to define different cases.
char: Declares a character variable.
const: Defines a constant variable.
continue: Continues the execution of the loop after the current iteration.
default: Used in switch statements to define the default case.
do: Repeats a block of code until a condition is met.
double: Declares a double-precision floating-point variable.
else: Used in conditional statements to define the code to be executed when a condition is false.
enum: Declares an enumeration type.
extern: Specifies that a variable or function is defined in another file.
float: Declares a single-precision floating-point variable.

typedef: Defines a new type by giving an existing type a new name.
union: Declares a union type.
